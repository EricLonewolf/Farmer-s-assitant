//Farmer's assitant is an -explain-
//We are taking rice as an example for our bot it is one of the most cruicial and popularly grown crop across our country
/*The future plans with farmer's assistant are to include all the major and minor crops which can be grown on Indian soil so as to help the
farmers be prepared for any circumstances and maximize there production leading to the development of our country*/
//We are providing the basic structure of our code and bot's final look produced using 'Dialogflow' as of now as the frameworks required to make what we have envisioned requires us to hire a server
//We will be using c++ for the bot and OOPs concept is implementable, we shall we encorporating that.
//phase 1, phase 2, phase 3
//make probablity data sheet
//Data we are getting from the sensors-> pH, temperature, soil humidity, weather
//Data we are getting from the database based on the info given by the user-> possible pest on the crop in the area mentioned
//let the data base be-> Pestpossiblity
